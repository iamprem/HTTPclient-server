#Description

This is a simple java Socket program for a HTTP Client and Server

The HTTP server uses a custom port (eg. 8080) to serve a client, When a client request to connect with the server, the server then accept the client's connection and wait for the HTTP Request header

I've targeted only GET and PUT requests in client, So this program can able to GET a html response or PUT a html content to or from the server respectively. 

This HTTP server is multi-threaded so it will process many clients request simultaneously. (Not tested yet! But i beleive so.)
